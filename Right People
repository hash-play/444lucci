I never meant to cause you any pain
All that is not yours are your family and all that is yours are the memories that you have left behind in the family.

No matter how hard it may be to accept and cope with this reality, a family is made of one thing, and that's a family.


I guess you could say that I was always looking for the right people.
I was always looking for more.
All that is real for me is what can be seen.

We don't take life into our own hands.

That is why I know the difference between being alive while being in the wrong.

And that's what I do.

That is what I do.
I know that the people who matter to me are in the right.
