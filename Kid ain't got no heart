Someday I'm gonna take my place in that line
Oh, let the good times roll on
You can't take away my youth
I gotta break down what a bitch I am
If you want to touch me
You better turn around, come on, come with me
The light in this city is on but not enough
This ain't the only place
This ain't the only one that's lit by the same blue
That is the kind of darkness you can't see
They always say a kid ain't got no heart
But that's my son, that's my son no bitch
The light in this city is on but not enough
This ain't the only place
This ain't the only one that's lit by the same blue
That is the kind of darkness you can't see
They always say a kid ain't got no heart
But that's my son, that's my son no bitch
The light in this city is on but not enough
This ain't the only place
