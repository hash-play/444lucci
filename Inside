I don't want to be known by myself
I don't want to be alone
I want to be with someone

who understands what it's like to be me

But the pain, the loneliness, is still with me
And you are the only human inside
I've made you so empty inside
With you, I can take a break

I've made you so very lonely inside
You've never been in love in your life
You're alone inside
You've never loved anyone in your life

You've made me so afraid inside
I've made you so vulnerable inside
You've made me so fragile inside
I don't deserve it anyway

So please just die
Because I don't deserve you or anything
It's not fair for you to be on your own

You've never felt love in your life
You're just an empty shell inside
You've made me so empty inside

I deserve it anyway, true love

I deserve it anyway, true love
