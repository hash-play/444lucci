You want someone to look for you in the darkness


I want you to take me out to the dance, and when my time comes


You'd best believe I'll be there on your dime


I see the light, I see you, my friend, my lady
You have a friend, my friend, my lady
I hear you, I hear you, my lady, my friend
You have a friend, my friend, my lady.

 

You want someone to stand out in the crowd
I want you to be the first to step onto the dance floor


I'll get there, I'll get there, I'll get there, 

I'll get there, I'll get there, I'll get there, 

 

I see the light, I see you, my friend, my lady
You have a friend, my friend, my lady
I hear you, I hear you, my lady, my friend
You have a friend, my friend, my lady.
