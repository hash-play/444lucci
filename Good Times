I never meant to hurt you as bad as you did me
and now i will never see those eyes once again
I will always remember how you said goodbye
I will always remember how you told me "i wish i could kiss you
and when i said goodbye i thought "i can't and i can't"
but now i will remember the good times
the good times i never felt
the good times the good times
and I will always remember you in my heart
I will always remember you
And you know what?

I don't even care about my time.

I don't even care about the times I spent with you.

What I know is that we both knew a time when we were meant to be alone.

I don't care if I have regrets, because you're gone now and I am not.

And I will cherish every second we ever had together.
