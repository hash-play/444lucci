My name is Nils Eriksson

My face is the face of ice.

My voice is the voice of a god

And my voice, if I should speak of it,

Would make your father go blind.


I never meant to cause fear,

Not for you or for my family or for you

But for the world and for the way of your life,

I only wish you good luck.

I wish you to be free.


But you and your mother

Are my only hope for now.

You are the only one

I want to keep close.


I never meant the world to end

But I did, somehow,

I'll never forget you my daughter.

And I'm so terribly sorry.


My name is Nils Eriksson

My face is the face of ice.

My voice is the voice of a god

And my voice, if I should speak of it
