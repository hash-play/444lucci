How do you make love with a dead body?
Well, my heart's an open wound
The truth, the honest truth's too sweet

How do you be my lover, oh
'Cause I'm going to try my best to look good
I'm going to try my best to look good

'Cause I'm going to try my best to look nice
I'm going to try my best to look nice
I'm going to try my best to look nice

How do you make love with a dead body?
Creeping, sneaking around like never before
And all I hear is a dull, muffled sound
Sweat dripping all over my body

Nowhere to hide from the world's eyes
Creep around like you never thought that you was dead
You're gonna wake up and be a man
Your whole life is going to be changed


The truth, the honest truth's too sweet

The truth, the honest truth's too sweet

The truth, the honest truth's too sweet
