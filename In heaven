In heaven


Trying to run from me that I'll knock you out
Running from me that I'll knock you out
Running from me that I'll knock you out
Running from me, I'll knock you out, I'll knock you out


Don't wake me up
It's just an old dream to me
Don't wake me up, wake me up
It's just an old dream to me
Don't wake me up, wake me up
It's just an old dream to me
Don't wake me up, wake me up
It's just an old dream to me
Don't wake me up, wake me up


Run from me, that I'll knock you out
Running from me, I'll knock you out, I'll knock you out
Running from me, I'll knock you out
Run from me, I'll knock you out, I'll knock you out


Don't wake me up
It's just an old dream to me
Don't wake me up, wake me up
It's just an old dream to me
Don't wake me up, wake me up
It's just an old dream to me
Don't wake me up, wake me up
It's just an old dream to me
Don't wake me up, wake me up
