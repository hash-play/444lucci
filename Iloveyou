Yeah, you know you're no better than me
Who cares when they see your eyes

Your hair and skin
We're going to be in a war

Yeah, you know you're no better than me
Who cares when they see your eyes

Your hair and skin
We're going to be in a war

Yeah, you know you're no better than me
Who cares when they see your eyes

 I love you, I love you, I love you,
 I love you, I love you, I love you,

 I love you, I love you, I love you,
 I love you, I love you, I love you,
