you're so dead
You're so scared, you're so sick
All I wanna do to you
And you know that's right

I'll keep killing you
I'm not afraid to touch you
You know that's right
You know that's right

I'll keep killing you
I'm not afraid to touch you
You know that's right
I'll keep killing you

Sleeping, you're on your toes
Tiptoeing around like no one knows
Creeping around like no one knows
All I wanna do to you

And you think you're so crazy
You're stupid, you're so sick
All I wanna do to you
And you know that's right

I'll keep killing you
I'm not afraid to touch you
You know that's right
I'll keep killing you

I'll keep killing you
I'm not afraid to touch you
You know that's right
I'll keep killing you
