Who's there for you

Now there's this new world

There's this new world

And there's this new world

This world's getting better and worse every day

And the entire human race is getting worse and worse every day

The world's getting worse and worse every day

The world's getting worse and worse every day

I'm not in trouble

I've still got my faith

I'm not in trouble

This world's getting better and worse every day

And the entire human race is getting worse and worse every day

The world's getting worse and worse every day

The world's getting worse and worse every day
