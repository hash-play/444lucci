That you've had your turn
You've been called to the front row
You've been given the keys


To your God's kingdom
To make the world a better place
Don't forget your brothers and sisters
Don't forget the people lost
Don't forget the families that have been broken
Don't forget the children in the orphanages
Don't forget the men and women just getting by
And the world is on fire We've been forgiven
We're safe but not completely clean
We've been forgiven
We're forgiven


We forgive
We forgive
We forgive
We forgive
We forgive
We forgive
We forgive
We forgive
