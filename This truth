This truth I've held to from childhood,

All this I've seen, all I've seen

But I'll never be able to forget

So my heart beats a little fast, my heart is beating fast

I think it's all in me

All this I've seen, all I've seen
All this I've seen, all I've seen
All this I've seen, all I've seen

This truth


If there's no love there,
Just as the air is dry, we don't know if there'll be love there.
A truth so loud you can't ignore

I will always be there
And so will you
