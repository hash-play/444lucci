We are here on our mission

And together we have the power

And each of us has a role to play

The world we are creating together

The world we are creating together

We need you to help us and we need you to help each other

We are one people


We are all one family So make sure you do that.

"It will be our turn now

For peace and prosperity to reign!"

And I will remember

Where we spent our time together

And how I made you laugh

I will remember

You and the countless good times

I will remember

And the many times I was there

And the hours I spent with you


"It's okay"

"Yeah. It's okay."

You may always be there

You may always be there

"Yes indeed it is"

In the end our dreams must match our will

"I just don't need a friend"

There is no need to look for a friend

"But I love you like a brother"

"Yeah. But I still miss that old friend

And we have a special place together."

"You got a real good friend"


"Oh yeah."

And I shall live the rest of my days

With you and with the countless good times

And the countless times I spent with you

"It's okay"

There's no need to search for another friend
