There's so much that I like about you
Your lips so soft, all my body can't be
Now, how about we go somewhere
Some place you know, but I don't even know
There's so much I like about you

I'm so sick of your boring songs
I've been waiting for you
Don't let me down, don't you fool me

Oh I love you, I think I love you, oh

I'm so glad I'm not alone

I love you too, I hate to see you

I'm so sick of your boring songs
I've been waiting for you
Don't let me down, don't you fool me

Oh I love you, I think I love you, oh

I'm so glad I'm not alone

I love you too, I hate to see you
